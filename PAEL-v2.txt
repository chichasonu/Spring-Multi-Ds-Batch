This will prepare you for any review, presentation or Q&A panel.


---

🔷 1. Executive / Senior Leadership Q&A

Q1. What business problem are we solving?

A: Sudden unexplained risk jumps occur frequently, but current processes rely on manual investigation, taking 2–4 hours per event. This slows response time and leaves critical exposures unaddressed.


---

Q2. What is the ROI?

A:

80% reduction in investigation time

60–70% drop in manual escalation

Faster identification of risk spikes → lower financial exposure

SME bandwidth freed to focus on high-value activities



---

Q3. Why now?

A:

Trade volumes have grown substantially (30k–60k trades/day).

Manual monitoring can’t scale.

AI/ML models now mature enough to provide real-time diagnostics.



---

Q4. How does this support our risk governance strategy?

A: It shifts risk management from a reactive model to a proactive, predictive model through automated early-warning systems.


---

Q5. What is the cost and timeline?

A:

Uses existing market and risk data—no major infra upgrade needed.

Total implementation time: 10–14 weeks for MVP.



---


---

🔷 2. Business / Risk Manager Q&A

Q6. How will this help risk managers day-to-day?

A:

Instant anomaly alerts instead of multi-hour manual checks.

Automated root-cause analysis shows which trades caused the jump.

Reduces dependency on quants for first-level diagnosis.



---

Q7. Can it reduce false alarms?

A:
Yes—multi-layer validation (Z-score + MAD + Isolation Forest) ensures only meaningful deviations trigger alerts.


---

Q8. Does this system replace human judgment?

A:
No, it augments it. The system automates detection; human experts validate and act.


---

Q9. How does the AI explain an anomaly?

A:
LLMs analyze contributing metrics (Delta, Vega, NPV, Greeks, volume, counterparty) and generate explanations in plain English.


---


---

🔷 3. Quant / Data Science / Technical Q&A

Q10. What models are we using for anomaly detection?

A:

Statistical: Z-Score, MAD

Machine Learning: Isolation Forest, Rolling Baselines

Optional: Autoencoders for high-dimensional risk metrics



---

Q11. Why Isolation Forest?

A:

Effective in high-dimensional trade data

Works well with irregular distributions

Low computational cost → real-time scoring



---

Q12. How do we handle drift in market conditions?

A:
Dynamic rolling windows automatically adjust baselines to reflect current volatility and trend.


---

Q13. What are the data requirements?

A:

Historical trades (6–24 months)

Risk metrics (Delta, Gamma, Vega, NPV, PV01, etc.)

Market data snapshots

Optional P&L series



---

Q14. What’s the system architecture?

A:

Data ingestion layer

Baseline modeling engine

ML anomaly scoring service

LLM-based reasoning engine

Dashboard/alerting layer



---

Q15. What about model performance and validation?

A:

Backtesting on historical risk-breaking events

Precision/recall tuning

Stress testing against market shocks

Model monitoring to detect degradation



---


---

🔷 4. Compliance / Audit / Governance Q&A

Q16. Is this model explainable?

A:
Yes—statistical thresholds, feature contributions, and LLM explanation layers provide full traceability.


---

Q17. Are there risks of biased outputs?

A:
No—the model evaluates numerical trade/risk data, not personal or subjective factors. Bias is minimal.


---

Q18. How is data privacy handled?

A:
All data stays within the firm's secured environment; no personal information is processed.


---

Q19. How are decisions logged for audit?

A:
Every anomaly, score, model decision, and root-cause summary is logged in a tamper-proof audit store.


---


---

🔷 5. Engineering / Implementation Q&A

Q20. How scalable is this system?

A:
Designed to handle 60k+ trades/day with real-time scoring.
Isolation Forest ensures sub-second scoring latencies.


---

Q21. Will this integrate with current risk systems?

A:
Yes. Inputs/outputs match existing risk metrics and can be plugged into the current system via APIs or batch feeds.


---

Q22. What about performance overhead?

A:
The system is lightweight—designed to run alongside existing risk calculations without adding noticeable latency.


---


---

🔷 6. End-User / Analyst Q&A

Q23. What will I see in the UI?

A:

Heatmaps of anomalies

Trade-level contributions

Trend charts with spikes highlighted

LLM summary of findings

Recommended next steps



---

Q24. How fast will I get an alert?

A:
Within seconds of trades or risk calculations being processed.


---

Q25. What’s the biggest benefit for analysts?

A:
No more sifting through thousands of trades manually.
The system tells you exactly what happened and why.


---


---

🔷 7. Strategic / Future Vision Q&A

Q26. Can this be expanded to other asset classes?

A:
Yes—Equities, Rates, Commodities can all use similar baseline models with different risk metrics.


---

Q27. Can GenAI be used to automate remediation as well?

A:
Yes—future versions can trigger preventive actions such as controlling limits or generating risk incident reports.


---

Q28. What’s the long-term roadmap?

Enterprise-wide anomaly detection

Cross-asset risk insights

Real-time scenario simulation

Automated risk triaging
