“Let me explain this architecture step by step.

We start with the user on mobile or another channel. Their request first comes into the Client Service and Conversation Gateway, which acts as the entry point.

From here, the request can optionally go through Dialogflow for basic intent capture, but the real orchestration happens in the Parent Agent.

The Parent Agent is the brain of this system. It applies two key capabilities:

Detour Prevention, which makes sure users only ask banking-related questions, staying within scope.

Short-term memory, which allows the system to remember context across turns in a conversation.

Once the Parent Agent understands the request, it routes it to the right specialized agent. These include agents for Answer Hub, Rules Engine, Cards, Transactions, Accounts, NM (next-best-message), and TPH (third-party hub). Each of these agents connects to backend systems using MCP interfaces, which makes the integrations modular and reusable.

Finally, the selected agent processes the request, returns the response, and the Parent Agent delivers it back to the user through the gateway.

On the top right, you can see what’s in progress — a visual workflow designer. This gives us a flow view similar to Dialogflow, but built on top of ADK. It makes the system easier to manage and update, even for non-developers, while retaining the flexibility of code-driven orchestration.

So overall, this architecture combines enterprise-grade orchestration, strict domain control, reusable integrations, and an easy-to-use visual flow builder — much more powerful than what Dialogflow alone can provide.”
