TradeSentinel FX – Automated FX Risk Anomaly Detection and Analysis

Problem Statement

The current FX Risk system calculates risk metrics for large trade populations (30k–60k) but faces sudden unexplained risk jumps.

No automated anomaly detection or comparison to historical patterns delays identification of risk breaks.

Manual investigations take 2–4 hours per event, requiring multiple resources (quants, product owners).

Leads to delayed responses and unaddressed critical exposures, with ~1,000 events per year.


Challenges:

⏱️ Investigation Time: 2–4 hours/event

👥 Resource Intensive: Multiple teams needed

⚠️ Delayed Response: Risk exposures may go unnoticed



---

Proposed Solution: TradeSentinel FX

An AI-driven, real-time trade anomaly detection and analysis system designed to:

Monitor FX risk metrics continuously.

Detect and diagnose sudden, unexplained risk changes promptly.


Core Technologies:

Statistical Modeling

Machine Learning

AI-driven Diagnostics


Benefits:

Improves operational efficiency by 80%.

Scalable for large trade volumes.

Three-Step Analytical Framework

Step 1: Baseline Modeling

Establishes normal trade behavior using:

Historical Trade Metrics (Delta, Greeks, NPV, Margin).

Reference Framework for normal patterns.

Dynamic Rolling Windows to adapt baselines to market changes.


Provides the foundation for anomaly detection.


Step 2: Anomaly Detection

Combines Statistical Outlier Detection (Z-Score, MAD) with Machine Learning:

Isolation Forest for complex anomalies in high-dimensional data.

Real-time Scoring of incoming trades to detect risk instantly.



Step 3: AI-driven Root Cause Analysis

Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) for contextual anomaly analysis.

Automated Diagnostic Process reduces manual investigation effort.

Enables Faster Issue Resolution and Proactive Risk Management by surfacing root causes and preventive insights.

Overall Impact

⏱️ Reduces investigation time by up to 80%.

🤖 Automates anomaly detection and root cause analysis.

📈 Enables real-time monitoring and proactive risk control.

🧠 Empowers risk teams with AI insights for faster decision-making.
